1. “Surely computers cannot be intelligent – they can only do what their programmers tell them.” Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?

The latter statement is true because computers do not have a conscience, and the latter statement does imply the former one.


2. “Surely animals cannot be intelligent – they can only do what their genes tell them.” Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?

The latter statement is true because just like computers, animals would lose the capability to rational decisions for themselves. The former statement is also implied in this statement.


3. “Surely neither animals, humans, nor computers can be intelligent – they can do only what their constituent atoms are told to do by the laws of physics.” Is the latter statement true, and does it imply the former?

The latter statement is true because without our constituent atoms, we would have any neurons, which directly effect our emotions and our cerebral cortex, which directly affect out capability of emotion and thought. This statement also implies the former, just like the preivous two.
